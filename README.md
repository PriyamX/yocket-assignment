What is Cucumber?
Cucumber is an open source tool that supports Behavior Driven Development (BDD) framework. It provides the facility to write tests in a human readable language called Gherkin. Selenium executes UI tests while Cucumber does acceptance testing.

Feature
Scenario / Scenario Outline
Given, When, Then, And, But
